  "Either wire existing and already instantiated component or instantiate a

   side.
   When a previous component with the same name exists, this function first of
   all unwires that previous component by unsubscribing and untapping all
   connected channels. Then, the state of that previous component is used in the
   new component in order to provide a smooth developer experience.
   Finally, the new component is tapped into the switchboard's firehose and the
   component is also asked to publish its state once (also useful for Figwheel)."
